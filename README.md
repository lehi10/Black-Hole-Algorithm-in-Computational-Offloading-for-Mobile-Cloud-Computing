### Paper Base : A Dynamic Programming Offloading Algorithm for Mobile Cloud Computing 
_"Computational  offloading  is  an  effective  method  to  address   the   limited   battery   power   of   a   mobile   device,   by   executing some components of a mobile application in the cloud. In  this  paper,  a  novel  offloading  algorithm  called  ‘Dynamic  Programming  with  Hamming  Distance  Termination’ ..."_
